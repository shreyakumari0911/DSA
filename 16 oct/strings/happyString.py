'''
    A string s is called happy if it satisfies the 
    following conditions:

s only contains the letters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
s does not contain any of "aaa", "bbb", or "ccc" as a
 substring.
s contains at most a occurrences of the letter 'a'.
s contains at most b occurrences of the letter 'b'.
s contains at most c occurrences of the letter 'c'.
Given three integers a, b, and c, return the longest 
possible happy string. If there are multiple longest happy
strings, return any of them. If there is no such string, 
return the empty string "".
